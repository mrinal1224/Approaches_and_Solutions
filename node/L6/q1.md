### Problem Statement

You need to develop a simple visit counter feature in an Express.js application.
This feature will track the number of times a user has visited the `/visit` endpoint using cookies.

1. **Cookie Management**: Utilize cookies to store and track the number of visits.
2. **Route Setup**: Create a route `/visit` that handles GET requests.
3. **Visit Counter Logic**: Increment the visit counter stored in a cookie if it exists; otherwise, initialize it.
4. **Response**: Return a message to the user indicating the number of times they have visited the page.

### Code Stub

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");

const app = express();
app.use(cookieParser());

app.get("/visit", (req, res) => {
  // Implementation for visit counting
});

module.exports = app;
```

### Solution Approach

- **Middleware Configuration**: Utilize `cookie-parser` to handle cookies within the app.
- **Check and Update Cookie**: In the `/visit` route, check if the `visitCount` cookie exists.
  - If it exists, increment its value.
  - If not, set it to 1.
- **Set Cookie and Respond**: Update the response to include the updated cookie and return a message to the user showing the visit count.

### Complete Solution

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");
const app = express();
app.use(cookieParser());

app.get("/visit", (req, res) => {
  let visitCount = req.cookies.visitCount;
  if (visitCount) {
    visitCount = Number(visitCount) + 1;
  } else {
    visitCount = 1;
  }
  res.cookie("visitCount", visitCount, { httpOnly: true });
  res.send(`This is your visit number ${visitCount}`);
});

module.exports = app;
```

**Title:** Building a Basic Express.js Application with Middleware and Routing

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with creating a basic Express.js application. The application should perform the following operations:

1. Set up an Express.js application.
2. Define two routes: a GET route at the path "/" and a POST route at the path "/data".
3. The GET route should respond with a JSON object containing a message: `{ "message": "Welcome to our API!" }`.
4. The POST route should accept JSON data in the format `{ "name": "John Doe" }` and respond with a JSON object containing a message: `{ "message": "Hello, John Doe!" }`.
5. Implement a middleware function that logs the request method and the request path for each incoming request.

**Code Stub:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Your code goes here

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running at http://localhost:3000");
});
```

**Solution:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request method: ${req.method}, Request path: ${req.path}`);
  next();
});

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Welcome to our API!" });
});

app.post("/data", (req, res) => {
  const name = req.body.name;
  res.json({ message: `Hello, ${name}!` });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running at http://localhost:3000");
});
```

Note: This solution assumes that the 'express' module is installed in your project. If not, you can install it using `npm install express`.

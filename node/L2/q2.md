**Title:** Building a Basic Express.js Application with File-based Database

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with creating a basic Express.js application. The application should perform the following operations:

1. Set up an Express.js application.
2. Define two routes: a GET route at the path "/users" and a POST route at the path "/users".
3. The GET route should read a local JSON file named "users.json" and respond with its content.
4. The POST route should accept JSON data in the format `{ "name": "John Doe" }`, add it to the "users.json" file, and respond with the updated list of users.
5. Implement a middleware function that logs the request method and the request path for each incoming request.

**Code Stub:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const fs = require("fs");
const app = express();

// Your code goes here

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running at http://localhost:3000");
});
```

**Solution:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const fs = require("fs");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request method: ${req.method}, Request path: ${req.path}`);
  next();
});

app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  fs.readFile("users.json", "utf8", (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    res.json(JSON.parse(data));
  });
});

app.post("/users", (req, res) => {
  fs.readFile("users.json", "utf8", (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    const users = JSON.parse(data);
    users.push(req.body);
    fs.writeFile("users.json", JSON.stringify(users, null, 2), (err) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      res.json(users);
    });
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running at http://localhost:3000");
});
```

Note: This solution assumes that the 'express' module is installed in your project. If not, you can install it using `npm install express`. Also, make sure to have a "users.json" file in your project directory with initial data as an empty array `[]`.

# Title: File Operations and Data Processing with Node.js fs Module

## Problem Description:

You are tasked with creating a script using Node.js fs (file system) module. The script should perform the following operations:

Read a text file named "input.txt". The text file contains multiple lines of text.
Count the number of lines in the text file.
Write the line count into a new file named "output.txt". If the file already exists, it should overwrite the existing content.
`Code Stub:`

```js
const fs = require("fs");

// Your code goes here
```

`solution:`

```js
const fs = require("fs");

fs.readFile("input.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  const lines = data.split("\n").length;
  fs.writeFile("output.txt", `The file contains ${lines} lines.`, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("The file has been saved!");
  });
});
```

**Title:** Implementing a GET Route to Fetch All Movies

**Problem Description:**

You need to create a GET route at the path "/movies" using Express.js.
This route will be responsible for retrieving all movie records from a MongoDB database and responding with the result in JSON format.
The database contains a collection of movies, each adhering to a specific schema (which is provided in the code stub).
Your task is to implement the GET route so that it connects to the MongoDB database, retrieves all movie.

1. Define a GET route at the path "/movies".
2. The GET route should retrieve all movies from the MongoDB database and respond with the result.

**Code Stub:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp", {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

const Movie = mongoose.model(
  "Movie",
  new mongoose.Schema({
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    description: { type: String, required: true },
    duration: { type: Number, required: true },
    genre: { type: String, required: true },
    language: { type: String, required: true },
    releaseDate: { type: Date, required: true },
    poster: { type: String, required: true },
  })
);

// Your code goes here.

module.exports = { app, Movie };
```

### Hints:

1. **Setup Express and Mongoose**: Make sure Express and Mongoose are configured properly to handle routes and database operations.
2. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure your database connection via Mongoose is established correctly.
3. **Define Mongoose Model**: Create a schema for movies with all required fields and ensure the schema matches the requirements of the database documents.
4. **Implementing the GET Route**: This route will fetch all movies from the database and return them as JSON.

### Solution Approach:

1. **Initialize Dependencies**:
   - Import and configure necessary libraries (`express`, `mongoose`).
2. **Database Connection**:
   - Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose and a specified connection string.
3. **Define Mongoose Model**:
   - Define a `Movie` model with a schema that includes fields for title, description, duration, genre, language, release date, and poster.
4. **Route Setup**:
   - Implement a GET route at `/movies` that queries all movies from the database using `Movie.find()`.
5. **Error Handling**:
   - Use try-catch blocks within your route handling to catch and respond to errors, typically sending a `500 Internal Server Error` when something goes wrong.

**Solution:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

mongoose.connect(
  "mongodb+srv://guptat320:rK4rUDI9mK5JIuw5@scaler.ptkqtj4.mongodb.net/scaler?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=scaler",
  {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  }
);

const Movie = mongoose.model(
  "Movie",
  new mongoose.Schema({
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    description: { type: String, required: true },
    duration: { type: Number, required: true },
    genre: { type: String, required: true },
    language: { type: String, required: true },
    releaseDate: { type: Date, required: true },
    poster: { type: String, required: true },
  })
);

app.get("/movies", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const movies = await Movie.find({});
    res.json(movies);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).send(err);
  }
});

module.exports = { app, Movie };
```

Note: These solutions assume that the 'express' and 'mongoose' modules are installed in your project. If not, you can install them using `npm install express mongoose`. Also, make sure to replace 'mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp' with your actual MongoDB connection string.

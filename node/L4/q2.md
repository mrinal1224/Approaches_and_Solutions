**Title:** Implementing a POST Route to Add a New Movie

**Problem Description:**

You need to create a POST route at the path "/movies" using Express.js.
This route will be responsible for accepting JSON data to create a new movie in the MongoDB database and responding with the created movie.
The database contains a collection of movies, each adhering to a specific schema (which is provided in the code stub).
Your task is to implement the POST route so that it connects to the MongoDB database, creates a new movie record with the provided JSON data, and sends the created movie back.

1. Define a POST route at the path "/movies".
2. The POST route should accept JSON data, create a new movie in the MongoDB database, and respond with the created movie.

**Code Stub:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp", {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

const Movie = mongoose.model(
  "Movie",
  new mongoose.Schema({
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    description: { type: String, required: true },
    duration: { type: Number, required: true },
    genre: { type: String, required: true },
    language: { type: String, required: true },
    releaseDate: { type: Date, required: true },
    poster: { type: String, required: true },
  })
);

// Your code goes here.

module.exports = { app, Movie };
```

### Hints:

1. **Middleware Setup**: Ensure Express is configured to parse JSON bodies using `express.json()`.
2. **Mongoose Model**: Define a comprehensive schema that captures all the necessary fields for a movie.
3. **POST Route Implementation**: The route should handle creating a new movie document in the MongoDB database using the data received in the request body.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for scenarios such as database errors or validation failures.

### Solution Approach:

1. **Set Up Dependencies**:
   - Import necessary libraries (`express`, `mongoose`).
   - Ensure Express is set up to parse JSON bodies.
2. **Database Connection**:
   - Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose with a specified connection string.
3. **Define Mongoose Model**:
   - Create a `Movie` model with a schema detailing required fields: title, description, duration, genre, language, release date, and poster.
4. **Implement POST Route**:
   - Define a POST route at `/movies` that accepts JSON data, creates a new `Movie` instance, saves it to the database, and returns the created movie document.
5. **Error Handling**:
   - Include try-catch blocks to capture and respond to errors, particularly focusing on validation errors or database connection issues.

**Solution:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

mongoose.connect(
  "mongodb+srv://guptat320:rK4rUDI9mK5JIuw5@scaler.ptkqtj4.mongodb.net/scaler?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=scaler",
  {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  }
);

const Movie = mongoose.model(
  "Movie",
  new mongoose.Schema({
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    description: { type: String, required: true },
    duration: { type: Number, required: true },
    genre: { type: String, required: true },
    language: { type: String, required: true },
    releaseDate: { type: Date, required: true },
    poster: { type: String, required: true },
  })
);
app.post("/movies", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const movie = new Movie(req.body);
    const savedMovie = await movie.save();
    res.json(savedMovie);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).send(err);
  }
});
module.exports = { app, Movie };
```

Note: These solutions assume that the 'express' and 'mongoose' modules are installed in your project. If not, you can install them using `npm install express mongoose`. Also, make sure to replace 'mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp' with your actual MongoDB connection string.

**Title:** Implementing a DELETE Route to Remove a Movie by ID

**Problem Description:**

You are developing a web application using Express in Node.js.
Create an Express route that handles DELETE requests to the endpoint "/movies/".
This route should delete a movie by its ID from the MongoDB database and respond with a success message("successful element deleted").

1. Define a DELETE route at the path "/movies/:id".
2. The DELETE route should delete a movie by ID from the MongoDB database and respond with a success message.

**Code Stub:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp", {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

const Movie = mongoose.model(
  "Movie",
  new mongoose.Schema({
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    description: { type: String, required: true },
    duration: { type: Number, required: true },
    genre: { type: String, required: true },
    language: { type: String, required: true },
    releaseDate: { type: Date, required: true },
    poster: { type: String, required: true },
  })
);

// Your code goes here.

module.exports = app;
```

### Hints:

1. **Middleware Configuration**: Ensure that Express is set up to parse JSON bodies using `express.json()`.
2. **Database Connection**: Confirm the connection to MongoDB is established successfully.
3. **Model Definition**: Ensure the `Movie` model is defined correctly with the required fields to match the expected structure of the data.
4. **Route Definition**: The DELETE route should properly handle the operation of deleting a movie based on the provided ID.

### Solution Approach:

1. **Set Up Dependencies and Middleware**:
   - Use `express` for server setup and `mongoose` for database interactions.
   - Initialize middleware to parse JSON bodies.
2. **Database Connection**:
   - Establish a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose with appropriate connection options.
3. **Define Mongoose Model**:
   - Define a `Movie` model according to the schema provided in the stub code.
4. **Implement DELETE Route**:
   - Create a DELETE route at `/movies/:id` to handle the deletion of a movie by ID using `Movie.findByIdAndDelete`.
   - Check if the movie exists before deletion; respond with a 404 error if not found.
   - On successful deletion, return a success message.
   - Handle potential errors with appropriate status codes and messages.
5. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement robust error handling to catch and respond to errors effectively, including database errors and not found errors.

**Solution:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
app.use(express.json());

mongoose.connect(
  "mongodb+srv://guptat320:rK4rUDI9mK5JIuw5@scaler.ptkqtj4.mongodb.net/scaler?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=scaler",
  {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  }
);

const Movie = mongoose.model(
  "Movie",
  new mongoose.Schema({
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    description: { type: String, required: true },
    duration: { type: Number, required: true },
    genre: { type: String, required: true },
    language: { type: String, required: true },
    releaseDate: { type: Date, required: true },
    poster: { type: String, required: true },
  })
);

app.delete("/movies/:id", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const movie = await Movie.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id);
    if (!movie) return res.status(404).send("Movie not found");
    res.status(200).json({
      message: "successful element deleted",
    });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).send(err);
  }
});

module.exports = app;
```

Note: These solutions assume that the 'express' and 'mongoose' modules are installed in your project. If not, you can install them using `npm install express mongoose`. Also, make sure to replace 'mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp' with your actual MongoDB connection string.

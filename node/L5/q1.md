**Question: Implementing a Pre-save Hook in Mongoose for Validating Movie Duration**

**Detailed Problem Statement:**

In a Node.js application using Mongoose as an ODM for MongoDB, you are required to ensure data integrity for a "Movie" model.
This model includes several fields: title, description, duration, genre, language, releaseDate, and poster.
To maintain the integrity of the "duration" field, you need to implement a pre-save hook in the Mongoose schema.
This hook should validate that the movie's duration is neither negative nor zero, as such values are not logically valid for a movie's runtime.

1. Implement a pre-save hook on the "Movie" model.
2. Check if the "duration" field is less than or equal to zero.
3. If the duration is invalid, throw an error with the message: "Duration can't be negative or zero".
4. Allow the save operation to proceed if the duration is valid.

**Code Stub:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp", {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

const movieSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true },
  duration: { type: Number, required: true },
  genre: { type: String, required: true },
  language: { type: String, required: true },
  releaseDate: { type: Date, required: true },
  poster: { type: String, required: true },
});

// Your code to implement the pre-save hook goes here

const Movie = mongoose.model("Movie", movieSchema);
module.exports = Movie;
```

**Solution Approach:**

The solution involves adding a pre-save middleware to the Mongoose schema for the Movie model. This middleware will intercept the save operation, and it will check the value of the "duration" field:

- If the duration is less than or equal to zero, the middleware will halt the save operation by passing an error to the `next` callback function.
- If the duration is greater than zero, it will allow the save operation to continue by calling the `next` function without arguments.

**Complete Solution:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
app.use(express.json());

mongoose.connect(
  "mongodb+srv://guptat320:rK4rUDI9mK5JIuw5@scaler.ptkqtj4.mongodb.net/scaler?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=scaler",
  {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  }
);

const movieSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true },
  duration: { type: Number, required: true },
  genre: { type: String, required: true },
  language: { type: String, required: true },
  releaseDate: { type: Date, required: true },
  poster: { type: String, required: true },
});

movieSchema.pre("save", function (next) {
  if (this.duration <= 0) {
    const err = new Error("Duration can't be negative or zero");
    next(err);
  } else {
    next();
  }
});

const Movie = mongoose.model("Movie", movieSchema);
module.exports = Movie;
```

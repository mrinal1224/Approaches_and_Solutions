**Raw Problem**
Write internal CSS to select the elements that contain "Select me" as innerText and set the color as 'blue'.

Further, refer to the test cases to understand necessary requirements to submit the problem.

**Hints**

1. Use `#the-one` as the selector for the `div` that contains the target `p` and `div` elements.
2. Use the `Parent > Child` format to get the immediate children of the parent `div#the-one`.
3. Use `.c1.c2` to select both `p` and `div` elements.

**Solution Approach**
Using the parent-child relation between `div#the-one` and target elements of `p.c1.c2` and `div.c1.c2`, we write the CSS solution for the problem:

**Solution**

```css
.some-class #the-one > .c1.c2 {
  color: blue;
}
```

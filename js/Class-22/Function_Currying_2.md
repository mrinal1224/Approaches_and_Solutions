**Raw Problem**
You are required to implement a function `f` that calculates the product of two numbers, `x` and `y`. The function should support two different function call patterns: `f(x, y)` and `f(x)(y)`.

### Constraints:

- The function `f` should be able to handle positive and negative integer values for `x` and `y`.
- The function call patterns `f(x, y)` and `f(x)(y)` will only involve numerical inputs.

### Example:

```javascript
f(3, 4);
f(3)(4);
```

#### Output:

```
12
12
```

**Hints**

1. `f` should check the number of arguments to determine the function call pattern.
2. If two arguments are provided, calculate the product and return the result.
3. If one argument is provided, return a new function that waits for the second argument and calculates the product.
4. Use a conditional statement or check the length of the `arguments` object to differentiate between the patterns.
5. For `f(x, y)`, calculate the product and return.
6. For `f(x)(y)`, return a new function that multiplies `x` with the second argument.

**Solution Approach**

1.  Start by defining the function f with two parameters, x and y.
2.  Check the number of arguments passed to f using the arguments object or the length property.
3.  If arguments.length is equal to 1, return a new function that takes the second argument and computes the product.
4.  Inside the new function, multiply the captured x value (from the outer scope) with the second argument (y) and return the result.
5.  If arguments.length is equal to 2, directly calculate the product of x and y and return the result.
6.  Test the function using both function call patterns, such as f(3, 4) and f(5)(2), and verify that the correct products are returned.
7.  Remember to handle both function call patterns correctly and capture the necessary values in the inner function for the second pattern.

**Solution**

```javascript
function f(y, x) {
  if (arguments.length == 1) {
    return function (x) {
      return y * x;
    };
  } else {
    return x * y;
  }
}
```
